# Caffeinate

This is a little ruby program designed to help you find the closest coffeeshops near you via the command line. It uses the Yelp API and the Algorithmia API to help you get caffeinated.

To run this program,

* Obtain API keys for both Yelp and Algorithmia. Add these to a "secrets.yml" file.
* Run on the command line with `ruby drink_coffee.rb`
* Get yourself some coffee!
